# IPGeoSort
This app uses ``geoiplookup`` to find the country of origin
of a single or list of IP addresses in a file separated by line.
It then outputs the results sorted by alphabetical order (according
to its 2-character country-code)  to a file named geo<date-time>.txt

Syntax is ``ipgeosort.sh <filename>``
